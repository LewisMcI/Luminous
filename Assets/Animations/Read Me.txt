Can't Sync Up the Unity Project.

This how to implement the Animations. 


To adjust size, set Scale Factor in the Model Tab, when clicking on the file in Unity.

Replace the Object that is the player with the File "ModelWithRig"




Add an Animator component to the "ModelRigged" in the scene.

Select the Animator Controller in the Controller section of the Animator component.


^ Reference the Animator in the playerscript by referincing the object it is attached to. Example Script:


public Gameobject modelWithRig;
Animator Playeranim

Start()
{
Playeranim = modelWithRig.GetComponent<Animator>();

}


Call Playeranim.SetBool("isWalking", true) if you want the player to start walking
Call Playeranim.SetBool("isWalking", false) if you want the player to stop walking

Transitions and such is all done. It's just about getting it into Unity which I somehow can't use with Source Control
